Uvik test task

Problem : Create a Django app for the following game:
Description: A simple matching game uses a board that is a sequence of colored
squares. Each player has a game piece. Players alternate turns, drawing cards
containing either one colored square or two colored squares of the same color. Players
move their pieces forward on the board to the next square that matches the single
color on the card or forward to the second matching square if the card contains two
colored squares, or forward to the last square on the board if there is no square
matching the description above. A player wins if his piece lands on the last square of
the board. It is possible for all the cards to be drawn and still not have a winner.
